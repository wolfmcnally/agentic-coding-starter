If you're unsure which model to use, start with [Claude Opus 5.5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/models/opus-5-5/overview) for most workloads. Use [Claude Fable 5.1](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/models/fable-5-1/overview) for demanding reasoning and long-horizon agentic work, or when your evals on Claude Opus 5.5 at higher effort still fall short.

### Recommended effort levels for Claude Opus 5.5

Claude Opus 5.5 supports all five effort levels, and `medium` is the default (Claude Opus 5 and earlier Opus models default to `high`, so a request that omits `effort` runs one level lower than it did on Claude Opus 5). Adaptive thinking is always on and can't be turned off, so effort is the primary control for how much the model reasons and what a request costs. Run an effort sweep on your own evals rather than carrying settings over from an earlier model, and set a large `max_tokens` at the higher levels: it's a hard limit on total output (thinking plus response text).

### Recommended effort levels for Claude Fable 5.1

Claude Fable 5.1 supports all five effort levels. **Start with `high`, the default.** Step up to `xhigh` or `max` for the most capability-sensitive agentic and coding work, and step down to `medium` or `low` for routine or latency-sensitive work once your evals show quality holds.
